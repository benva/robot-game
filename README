--COMPILING & RUNNING

This program is to be compiled and run on a linux machine.
There is a makefile included in this directory. Run it like any other makefile.
ie:
	> make

And to remove all object files, exectuables, etc, run:
        
	> make clean

This will produce an exectuable named 'Game'. Run with:
     	
	> ./Game

All required features were implemented.
