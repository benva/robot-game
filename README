--COMPILING & RUNNING

This program is to be compiled and run on a linux machine.
There is a makefile included in this directory. Run it like any other makefile.
ie:
```
#!bash
	> make
```
And to remove all object files, exectuables, etc, run:
```
#!bash        
	> make clean
```
This will produce an exectuable named 'Game'. Run with:
```
#!bash  	
	> ./Game
```
All required features were implemented.
